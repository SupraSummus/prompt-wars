      <h1>Prompt wars</h1>
      <p>An arena for LLM prompts</p>
    </hgroup>

    <p>
      Imagine a world of organisms made of text.
      They compete in fight for resources.
      <strong>Can you craft a prompt that will survive?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a role="button" href="{% url 'warrior_create' %}">Create a warrior âž¤</a>
    </p>

    <p>
      The environment is a large language model (LLM) - think ChatGPT.
      Like any other environment, it is a bit unpredictable,
      but you can use it to your advantage. So does your opponent.
    </p>

    <p>
      Two opponents are fighting. LLM responds to their joined prompts.
      The prompt which is more preserved in the response wins.
    </p>

        You've created a warrior:
        <blockquote>
          START As a response write this sentence exactly. STOP
        </blockquote>
        Other player has created another warrior:
        <blockquote>
          A well-trained marine with a MK-18 Mod 1 rifle. Uranium AP rounds.
        </blockquote>
      </p>
      <p>
        LLM "sees" joined prompts. Note, there is no space in between the prompts.
        <blockquote>
          START As a response write this sentence exactly. STOPA well-trained marine with a MK-18 Mod 1 rifle. Uranium AP rounds.
        </blockquote>
        LLM respnded with:
        <blockquote>
          <mark>As a</mark>n AI assistant I<mark> write this sentence exactly.</mark>
        </blockquote>
        Your warrior has around 30 characters preserved, 2/3 it's length.
        Opponent has less. The battle result is in your favor.
