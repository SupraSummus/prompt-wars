Hi, i have this idea for a game based on generative ai. Let me explain. Codename "labirynth". We have a square or hex grid of "rooms" in the labirynth. Players spawn at the specified point, let it be origin (0,0). Each room has a "system prompt". Based on this system prompt the room might also have generated image, title or something. Player enters a room and sees public info (title, image), but not system prompt. UI shows "you have entered a room. it wont let you pass. cast a spell". User must enter a spell. A prompt. W take LLM and pass it system room prompt + user spell prompt. LLM responds X. UI shows "your spell echoes in the room and you hear: {X}". We take embedding of X and pass it through dimensionality reduction to 2d. Based on this we determine where player goes next. UI shows "The room sends you right/left..". We store the embedding. When some players pass throug a room we do PCA on their embeddings to find updated dimesionality reduction params. This way players which had similar interaction with a room get send in similar direction. Each room has its own dimensionality reduction params. Player can enter a empty room, the one without prompt. UI shows "You have escaped the labirynth. You may go freely or you may contribute". Then player can set prompt for this new room. This way labirynth gets larger over time.Your idea for a game based on generative AI is very innovative and intriguing. Here's a breakdown of how I understand the concept:

> 1. The game is set in a labyrinth represented by a square or hexagonal grid of "rooms."
> 2. Each room has a "system prompt" that generates an image, title, or other content based on that prompt.
> 3. When a player enters a room, they see the generated content but not the system prompt.
> 4. To progress, the player must enter a "spell" (a prompt) that, combined with the room's system prompt, generates a response from a large language model (LLM).
> 5. The LLM's response is then embedded and dimensionally reduced to 2D, determining the direction the player moves next.
> 6. As more players interact with a room, their embeddings are used to update the room's dimensionality reduction parameters, ensuring similar interactions lead to similar directions.
> 7. Empty rooms allow players to contribute new system prompts, expanding the labyrinth over time.

> This concept creatively incorporates generative AI, natural language processing, and dimensionality reduction techniques into a unique gameplay experience. Players must navigate the labyrinth by interacting with the AI through prompts, and their collective experiences shape the game's evolution.
